            <h2>High Hopes</h2>

            <p>
                Beyond the horizon <br>
                Of the place we lived when we were young<br>
                In a world of magnets and miracles<br>
                Our thoughts strayed constantly<br>
                And without boundary<br>
                The ringing of the division bell had begun
            </p>

                Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway<br>
                Do they still meet there by the Cut?<br>
                There was a ragged band<br>
                That followed in our footsteps<br>
                Running before time took our dreams away
            </p>

        <section class="normal">
            <p>
                Leaving the myriad small creatures<br>
                Trying to tie us to the ground<br>
                To a life consumed by slow decay<br>
                The grass was greener<br>
                The light was brighter<br>
                With friends surrounded<br>
                The nights of wonder
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="imagem">
            <p>
                Looking beyond the embers<br>
                Of bridges glowing behind us<br>
                To a glimpse of how green it was<br>
                On the other side<br>
            </p>   
                Steps taken forwards, but sleepwalking back again<br>
                Dragged by the force of some inner tide<br>
                At a higher altitude with flag unfurled<br>
                We reached the dizzy heights<br>
                Of that dreamed of world

        <section class="normal">
            <p>
                Encumbered forever by desire and ambition<br>
                There's a hunger still unsatisfied<br>
                Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon<br>
                Though down this road we've been so many times<br>
            </p>   
             <p>
                The grass was greener<br>
                The light was brighter<br>
                The taste was sweeter<br>
                The nights of wonder<br>
                With friends surrounded
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The dawn mist glowing<br>
                The water flowing<br>
                The endless river<br>
                Forever and ever<br>
            </p>
